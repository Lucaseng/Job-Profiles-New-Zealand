# Job Profiles New Zealand
Recently, I found that the New Zealand Occupational Outlook had been taken down. Furthermore, the dataset used to make statistical inferences for this website had also been removed.

Careers.govt.nz offers a platform for searching through over 400 different job profiles within New Zealand. However, their search platform lacks comprehensive sorting and filtering options.

Job Profiles New Zealand is a platform which looks to combine the strengths of both the Occupational Outlook and the careers.govt.nz platform: A visually appealing web and mobile application which allows users to comprehensively search through job profiles using a range of metrics.

## Backend Development
The Backend API was developed using ASP.Net Core Web API & MongoDB. 

Technologies:
- ASP.NET Core 7
- MongoDB 6.0

This API is not relational (which is why a NoSQL database has been used). Only six endpoints have been written.
